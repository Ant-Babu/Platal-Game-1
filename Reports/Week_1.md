# Thomas Tressel: This week, I especially focused on making sure the project could run on my Windows laptop. I installed WSL 2 using the Ubuntu distribution, then installed a GUI, and finally made sure I could run the demo of our project by installing necessary things such as CMake and SDL2. I had a few issues doing so, mainly regarding rendering the demo map with the GUI, and it took me quite some time to find my errors and configure everything properly. Once this was all done, I began looking at implementing the GameObject class for our game. Next week, I will mainly continue working on the GameObject class, now that I have set up everything needed for the project to run.
