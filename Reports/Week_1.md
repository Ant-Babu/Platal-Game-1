- Week 9th -15th November 2020: This week I mostly focused on installing the compiler and libraries such as cmake or sdl2 & sdl2_image , specifically for Mac, which will be essential when trying to code the game and which we will use in the upcoming weeks.

## Duong Dac

- Designed a simple structure for the game engine.
- Established:
  - development environment
  - source tree organization
  - git workflow
  - C++ styling
- Wrote manuals.
- Wrote headers with implementation details.

**Next week**: Design other components (`menu`, `item`, `task`, etc.).

## Elouan Gros

- I wrote the header files for the map class, the game class, and the texture manager
- I attempted to help my fellow group members install and run the project on windows, but without much success...
- Wrote and shared an SDL2 and SDL2_IMG demo with my fellow group members
- Next week, i plan on helping my fellow members complete their tasks, as well as work on the implementation of the Game object

## Carolina Nina Matos
- Attempted to install SDL2, unsuccessfully (I have a Mac computer and nobody, not even YouTube, seems to be able to help :( )
- Started drawing sprites to experiment with graphics style
- Did research on how to implement a texture manager and how to use SDL
- Spent some time figuring out how to work with GitHub

## Remy Seassau

- Spent some time trying to get SDL2 to work on windows (~2 hours on Wednesday + the full TD with about an hour of help from Mr Mover).
- Finally settled on using a Linux subsystem on Windows to compile the project (at this point we a small demo to test the dependencies). Spent about 30min to install SDL2 and compile the project in the subsystem.
- The project now compiles and I am ready to start coding my part of the engine: keyboard inputs.

## Nazila Sharifi Amina
I struggled with using installing SDL2 library and Cmake on windows, trying to figure out the installation process with online tutorials and my classmate's help. The solution was to install WSL and some other dependencies. It finally resulted in a successful build. Next week, I'll learn and try to implement SDL2 methods to get started on the game map and its display.

## Thomas Tressel

This week, I especially focused on making sure the project could run on my laptop. After first trying to simply have the project compile and run on Windows, I installed WSL 2 using the Ubuntu distribution, then installed a GUI, and finally made sure I could run the demo map of our project by installing necessary things such as CMake and SDL2. I had a few issues doing so, mainly regarding rendering our demo map with the GUI, and it took me a couple hours to find my errors and configure everything properly. Once this was all done, I began looking at implementing the GameObject class for our game. Next week, I will work on coding the GameObject class, now that I have set up everything needed for the project to compile.

## Tuna Yapakçı

This week I spent quite some time on figuring out how to install Cmake and required libraries (SDL2, SDL2 image) for the project on Windows. I tried many different methods on several IDEs (Qt, Virtual Studio, VSCode and CLion) to run the project, but none of them worked. In the end, I managed to compile the demo by installing a Linux subsystem. Finally I spent time to understand the current code and how SDL2 works.

## Antoine Babu

This week I worked on a function converting csv files into 2D arrays, which is how we will store and manipulate maps.
I am almost done with the function and will commit it in the next few days. My goal for next week is to work on visualizing these arrays and maybe implementing textures.
