- Week 9th -15th November 2020: This week I mostly focused on installing the compiler and libraries  such as cmake or sdl2 & sdl2_image , specifically for Mac, which will be essential when trying to code the game and which we will use in the upcoming weeks.

- Spent some time trying to get SDL2 to work on windows (~2 hours on Wednesday + the full TD with about an hour of help from Mr Mover).
- Finally settled on using a Linux subsystem on Linux to compile the project (at this point we a small demo to test the dependencies). Spent about 30min to install SDL2 and compile the project in the subsystem.
- The project now compiles and I am ready to start coding my part of the engine: keyboard inputs.

This week, I especially focused on making sure the project could run on my laptop. After first trying to simply have the project compile and run on Windows, I installed WSL 2 using the Ubuntu distribution, then installed a GUI, and finally made sure I could run the demo map of our project by installing necessary things such as CMake and SDL2. I had a few issues doing so, mainly regarding rendering our demo map with the GUI, and it took me a couple hours to find my errors and configure everything properly. Once this was all done, I began looking at implementing the GameObject class for our game. Next week, I will work on coding the GameObject class, now that I have set up everything needed for the project to compile.

This week I worked on a function converting csv files into 2D arrays, which is how we will store and manipulate maps. 
I am almost done with the function and will commit it in the next few days. My goal for next week is to work on visualizing these arrays and maybe implementing textures.
