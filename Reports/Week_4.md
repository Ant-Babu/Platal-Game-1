- I created a header for `clock.h`, a time managing system.
- As I was working on `clock.h`, I also drafted the structure for `Event` (classes, exams, etc.), `Task` (analysis homework, etc.), and `Day` (containing events, tasks, and map modifications). This is to achieve the *simulation* aspect of the game.
- Next week, I plan to finalize this structure into C++ headers.

- this week i helped Carolina with the testing of the texture manager; we managed to print a character texture to screen!
- this week i also completed the game::update function and setup the link between the game object and the protagonist object
- **next week** i plan on continuing to help the merging of everyone's work; i also plan on importing and linking the 
SDL_TTF library (to display dialogue); finally, i wish that i'll be able to set up a demo with a character that can move 
  on screen
