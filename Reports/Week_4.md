- I created a header for `clock.h`, a time managing system.
- As I was working on `clock.h`, I also drafted the structure for `Event` (classes, exams, etc.), `Task` (analysis homework, etc.), and `Day` (containing events, tasks, and map modifications). This is to achieve the *simulation* aspect of the game.
- Next week, I plan to finalize this structure into C++ headers.

- this week i helped Carolina with the testing of the texture manager; we managed to print a character texture to screen!
- this week i also completed the game::update function and setup the link between the game object and the protagonist object
- **next week** i plan on continuing to help the merging of everyone's work; i also plan on importing and linking the 
SDL_TTF library (to display dialogue); finally, i wish that i'll be able to set up a demo with a character that can move 
  on screen

## Remy Seassau
- This week I further improved the way we make charachters move

## Nazila Sharifi Amina
- This week I worked on class Map's methods. AddObject and RemoveObj are practically completed. A few little issues remain that I need to discuss with my teammates.

## Thomas Tressel
This week I continued working on the object class, specifically two Interact methods that are called when the player presses "E" and when a character collides with the object, if the object is collidable. These methods are not yet complete, as I was unsure as to what would be the best way for the two methods to work, and so I will need to discuss how to implement them well with my teammates.
