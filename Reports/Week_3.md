- Debugged the texture manager
- Vector was causing problems so I changed it to a map (which is the equivalent of a python dictionary, more or less)

Next steps: Test texture manager, debug again if necessary. Start linking texture manager to other relevant classes (like the map) / write the graphics rendering part
