This week I completed the map rendering, or at least the Map::Draw, which takes the map array and depending on the value renders different textures, using the different SDL functions and texture managers. This next week I will refine the map rendering if needed.

- This week I created some header files related to the quiz and question classes, and tried to implement some of the methods
Next week, I will continue working on this, as I need some help in order to complete the methods. I also need to think about how the quiz is going to be rendered.
