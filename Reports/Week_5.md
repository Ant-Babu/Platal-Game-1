- This week I completed the map rendering, or at least the Map::Draw, which takes the map array and depending on the value renders different textures, using the different SDL functions and texture managers. This next week I will refine the map rendering if needed.

- This week I finished the time manager `clock` and part of the activities manager `synapses`. I also did some code review. Next week, I will probably work with the graphic team on `map`, movements, and objects.
