- Managed to get SDL working on a Linux virtual machine
- Finished my first attempt at the texture manager (this has issues, which have been detailed in the code, and I am trying to get help to fix them)

Next steps: debug texture manager, get it to render at least a test image and maybe start using it to build (visually) part of the map
