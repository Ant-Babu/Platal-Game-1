- I worked on the implementation of the game object, defining most of its essential methods.
- I also worked on a cross platform makefile, that i tested on my windows machine and my linux machine and received good results. However, some of my comrades did have to tinker to make it work.
- **Next week** i thus plan to write the manual entry to use my makefile on windows, or even write a separate makefile for each platform (for ease of use), as well as making sure all objects interface correctly by running tests.

- Managed to get SDL working on a Linux virtual machine
- Finished my first attempt at the texture manager (this has issues, which have been detailed in the code, and I am trying to get help to fix them)

Next steps: debug texture manager, get it to render at least a test image and maybe start using it to build (visually) part of the map
